Scripts for everyday use in your $HOME/bin/
===========================================

This is my solution for having $HOME/bin/ in sync on different machines and I
thought some stuff might be useful for the public as well.

In case you think this stuff is useful for you, feel free to clone the
repository, but be aware I'm not taking over any guarantee at all.

If you have improvements to any of the scripts, I appreciate your pull request.
If you have any suggestions for additional scripts which might be useful here,
please also go ahead and fork this stuff and send me a pull request.
